Big 2: 

It is usually played with four players, the entire deck being dealt out in either case.
The objective of the game is to be the first to play of all of his cards.

Cards may be played as singles or in groups of two, three or five, in combinations which resemble poker hands. 
The leading card to a trick sets down the number of cards to be played; all the cards of a trick must contain the same number of cards. 
The highest ranking card is 2 instead of A. 
The combinations and their rankings are as follows, mostly based on poker hands:

Sngle cards: Any card from the deck, ordered by rank with suit being the tie-breaker. 
(For instance, A of Spades Beats A of Hearts which beats King of Hearts.)

Pairs: Any two cards of matching rank, ordered as with singular cards by the card of the higher suit.
A pair consisting of the K of Spades and K of Clovers beats a pair consisting of K of Hearts and K Diamonds.

Triples: Three equal ranked cards. 
Rank is determined by value of the three cards.

Five-card hands: 
There are five different valid five-card hands, ranking from low to high as follows (the same ranking as in poker, where applicable):
Straight:
Any 5 cards in a sequence (but not all of the same suit). 
Rank is determined by the value of the biggest card, with the suit used only as a tie-breaker. 
Therefore 3-4-5-6-7 < 2-3-4-5-6, since 2 is considered the largest card in the 2-3-4-5-6 straight.
Flush:
Any 5 cards of the same suit (but not in a sequence). Rank is determined by Face value of the cards (highest first, then each lower card in order). Suit rank is used to break ties. 
Full house:
a composite of a three-of-a-kind combination and a pair. 
rank is determined by value of the triple
Four-of-a-kind + One card:
Any set of 4 cards of the same rank, plus any 5th card. 
Rank is determined by the value of the 4 card set, regardless of the value of the 5th card. 
Straight flush: 
A composite of the straight and the flush: five cards in sequence in the same suit.
Ranked the same as straights, suit being a tie-breaker. 

A chosen dealer shuffles the deck after every gamme, then passses out all of the cards in equal distributions.

At the beginning of each game, the player with the 3 of Clovers starts by either playing it singly or as part of a combination, leading to the first trick.
Play proceeds counter-clockwise, with normal climbing-game rules applying: each player must play a higher card or combination than the one before, with the same number of cards. 
Players may also pass, thus declaring that s/he does not want to play.
 


The game ends when one player runs out of cards.


Scoring
Scoring is based off of who finishes first, second, third, etc.
